In the folder "To be used to segment Lungs" :
6 files can be found which has to be copy pasted in the same file as the DCM files! 
	4 X&Y cordinates --> for four different segmentation 
	1 readDCMfolder  --> To read the DCM files 
	1 matlab code    --> the code for segmenting the lungs 



In the folder "segmented lungs" :
41 files can be found!
	10 Segmented lungs from axial POV 
	10 Segmented lungs from Saggital POV 
	10 Segmented lungs from coronal POV
	10 Segmented lungs from noisy images
	1 matlab code to compare them! 


The lungs were segmented using the "To_segment_lungs" code for  the 10 intervals!
